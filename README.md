ðŸš€ Auth-NextJS Project Summary
This is a full-stack authentication system built with:

âœ… Next.js 15 (App Router, API routes, Middleware)

âœ… MongoDB (with Mongoose) for user data storage

âœ… Tailwind CSS for styling

âœ… Nodemailer + Mailtrap for email verification

âœ… JWT cookies for secure authentication

ðŸ”‘ Key Features
1. User Registration (Signup)
   New users can register with username, email, and password.
   Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs before saving in MongoDB.
   Sends a verification email to confirm the userâ€™s email address.
   Generates a secure random token for email verification.

2.Email Verification
  The user clicks the link in their email to verify.
  The /verifyemail page consumes the token and marks the user as isVerified=true in the DB.

3.User Login
  Only allows login for users with isVerified=true.
  On successful login, sets a JWT token in an HTTP-only cookie.

4.Protected Routes
  Middleware checks if the user is logged in (via cookie).
  Blocks access to /profile and other private pages if not authenticated.
  Redirects users appropriately between public and private pages.
  
5.Forgot Password (Optional but Supported)
  Generates a secure reset token.
  Sends a password reset link via email.
  Allows users to securely reset their password.
